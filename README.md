Carbon Emission Scaling in the USA
========

This is a project to correlate the levels of greenhouse gas emissions for US cities with various other urban demographics 
such as population and density. Three primary data sources were used:

* Emissions data for the U.S. was obtained from the [Vulcan Project](http://vulcan.project.asu.edu/research.php).
* Decennial census data was downloaded from [SocialExplorer](http://www.socialexplorer.com/explore/tables).
* The table containing counties for each MSA was obtained form the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](http://www.bea.gov/regional/docs/msalist.cfm "Statistical Areas")
